Use:
    To get a local copy of our code, simply run `git clone
    git@git.assembla.com:EECS395_26.git` into a local directory. Our repository
    is now open to the public for view access.

    If you wish to make edits, you will need to download Heroku Toolbelt (https://toolbelt.heroku.com/),
    Django using pip (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/?from=olddocs#install-the-django-code,
    look for the section entitled "Installing an official release with PIP"),
    and have at least Python version 2.6.
    
    Heroku also requires setting up a project space, to which we can add new members.
    Alternatively, you can establish your own project space at: http://www.heroku.com/.

    Our system is setup in Django, a Python-based web framework. Knowledge of
    Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is crucial in order to make meaningful
    edits to our code.

    We recommend getting familiar with Django and Heroku in order to have
    a complete system like the one found at refinecomments.herokuapp.com. User
    guides and walkthroughs on both of these systems can be found at their
    respective websites.
