			<h1>Refining the commenting experience:</h1>
			<h2>What if you could sort the comments on the news articles you read online to filter out everything except what truly matters to you? <br><br>Introducing Refine, a widget that filters comments based on topics you select.</h2>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="third">
			<h3>What is it exactly?</h3>
			<p>Refine is website tool that filters comments from popular sites into a friendly, readable format. Refine uses machine-learning to categorizes comments visually based on keywords. For websites that use the popular Disqus comment system, like CNN, Refine can highlight relevant or insightful comments. Such comments can often be lost in the noise of thousands upon thousands of user posts; Refine works to condense this content into meaningful keywords.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="third">
			<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
			<p>With Refine, users will not have to scroll through many comments to find the few they wanted to read. Keywords will appear below the article text in a word cloud, which users can click on to filter the comment stream by topic.</p>
		</div>
		
		
		<div class="third last">
			<h3>What's the end result?</h3>
			<p>By showing news consumers the comments that are most relevant and insightful to them, news organizations can offer a more personalized experience and inspire users to continue their contributions to the online commenting community.</p>
